<p>
    This small web app is a Work Order tracker I built to practice and demonstrate core
    CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.
    I wanted something simple and practical: a list of work orders that I can
    create, edit, view in detail, and delete—plus the ability to filter, search,
    sort, and paginate the results.
</p>

<p>
    The goal was to show that I understand how to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Display data in a table with clean formatting</li>
    <li>Create and edit records with forms</li>
    <li>Use enums for Status and Priority and show them with colored badges</li>
    <li>Filter by status, priority, department, and search text</li>
    <li>Sort by multiple columns (title, department, priority, status, dates)</li>
    <li>Handle pagination (page number and page size)</li>
    <li>Pass state through the query string so pages can be bookmarked/shared</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is intentionally focused and easy to read—good for a junior-level code review.
    Next improvements I would make:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add a real database (EF Core + SQLite)</li>
    <li>Add validation messages and stronger input rules</li>
    <li>Add authentication so only certain users can edit/delete</li>
    <li>Add unit tests for the filtering and sorting logic</li>
    <li>Expose a simple API endpoint for integration</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Thanks for reviewing the project. I built it to show practical fundamentals:
    data modeling, page handlers, query-based filtering, and clean, readable Razor markup.
